# bouncing_ball
Simple web programming challenge; create a single-page bouncing-ball app.

# Requirements

Build a single page JavaScript application (HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript). The application should:

* Display a round ball within the browserâ€™s frame using browser native SVG.
* Allow the ball size to be adjusted via a control in the lower right corner of the window.
* Let the user set the ball in motion with the mouse (such as by using mousedown-drag-mouseup or another scheme you feel is better).
* Uses the window edges to contain the ball - i.e. when the ball encounters a window edge, it bounces off and continues its motion.
* No Flash, Java, or Silverlight or other browser plugins.
* If you do use a DOM library, jQuery is preferred.
